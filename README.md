**Khet-Mitra** (Hindi for "Farm Friend") is an AI-powered, multilingual application designed to empower Indian farmers. It serves as a single, accessible digital toolkit for real-time agricultural intelligence, offering data-driven insights for crop health, soil management, and fair market access to enhance productivity and profitability.

- Lack of quick access to expert agricultural advice.
- Fragmentation of critical data like weather and market prices.
- Difficulty for small-scale farmers to secure fair market prices.
- Poor user experience of existing digital tools for rural farmers.
